Idea/Problem statement : - Problem to ensure line man safety with Password based Circuit Breaker.
Description of problem statement: - Nowadays, electrical accidents to the line man are increasing, while repairing the electrical lines due to the lack of communication between the electrical substation and maintenance staff. This project gives a solution to this problem to ensure line man safety by the use of Password based circuit breaker. In this proposed system, the control (ON/OFF) of the electrical lines lies with line man. This project is arranged in such a way that maintenance staff or line man has to enter the password to ON/OFF the electrical line. The password based circuit breaker control system is a system that access only specified password to control the circuit breaker. Here, there is also a provision of changing the password. Now, if there is any fault in electrical line, then the line man will switch off the power supply to the line by entering password and comfortably repair the electrical line, and after coming to the substation line man switch on the supply to the particular line by entering the password. Separate passwords are assigned for each electrical lines.
# Case Study: -
this project is arranged in such a way that maintenance staff or line Man to enter the password or use finger on sensor to ON/OFF the electrical line. A matrix keypad is interfaced to the microcontroller to enter the password while a relay driver IC is used to switch ON / OFF the loads through relays. The complete circuit is built with on board power supply. Now if there is any fault in electrical line then line man switch OFF the power supply to line by entering password and comfortably repair the electrical line and after coming the substation line man switch ON the supply to the particular line by entering password.
Best possible solution: -
# Principle of operation:-
The main component in the circuit is 8051 microcontroller. In this project 4×4 keypad is used to enter the password. The password which is entered is compared with the predefined password. If entered password is correct, then the corresponding electrical line is turned ON or OFF. In this project, a separate password is provided to each electrical line. Activation and deactivation of the line (circuit breaker) is indicated by the load (Light Bulbs).
# How to Design Password based Circuit Breaker Circuit? 
The above circuit consists of 8051 series controller (AT89C52), 4×4 Matrix Keypad, 16 x 2 LCD Display, 4 – Channel Relay Module and Four Loads. LCD data pins are
connected to PORT1 and control pins RS, RW and EN pins are connected to P3.0, GND and P3.1 respectively. Here, the LCD is used to display the information related to the load.
Keypad is connected to PORT2 of the microcontroller. The four Row Pins of the Keypad are connected to P2.0 to P2.3 and the four Column Pins are connected to P2.4 to P2.7. Using this keypad, we need to enter the password. Four Lamps (acting as Electrical Lines) are connected to P0.0 to P0.3 through the 4 – Channel Relay Module. These are used to indicate circuit breaker state (Light ON – Line Active and Light OFF – Line Not Active).
If you are not using the Relay Module, then you need to use 4 BC547 NPN Transistors (along with its current limiting base Resistor) in order to drive the relays. 
# WARNING: Be extremely careful when wiring the AC load to the Relay and mains supply.
